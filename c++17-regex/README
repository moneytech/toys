Regular expression was introduced in C++11. It was nice, however API
is awkward and unfriendly. I have to check in documentation how to
use regex almost every time.

This is a demo which shows that with minimal effort we can introduce
an object-oriented API which is straightforward and easy to use.
I picked std::string_view from C++17 as an underlaying type, but it's
obvious that std::string also would do the job (at cost of extra
allocations).
